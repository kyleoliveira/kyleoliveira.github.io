Since then, it has gone through a few name changes (Cal Aggie Collegiate 4-H Club, UC Davis Collegiate 4-H Club, and finally its current name), but its mission has not changed much: the club provides a way for past 4-Hers to get together, have fun, provide community service, and support the 4-H program in general. To these ends, the club also focuses on outreach to 4-Hers considering college, encouraging them to come to UC Davis and/or continue their 4-H career as Collegiate 4-H members.</p>
<p>I was a club member for all four of my years at UC Davis and during that time the club tended to stay small, always having somewhere between three and eight active members. This was nice in that our club became a fairly close-knit group and jumping into leadership roles (committee chairs, officer positions, etc.) was easy, if not practically required. At the same time though, our small size presented a few challenges.</p>
<p>First, large events or large quantities of events in a single quarter proved difficult to pull off. As a club officer I became adept at synchronizing club members' schedules so as to get the maximum number of participants there, just out of necessity. Further, this restricted the number of regular community service events we could organize and 4-H activities we could support because, on a quarter system, someone <em>always</em> had a midterm, essay, or class project due and school came first. Club trips were especially difficult - I tried to plan a snow trip almost every year to no avail. Winter Quarter was just too impacted for everyone.</p>

A social scientist would say that our club was an example of "group partnership" rather than "plug-in volunteering." We tended to be restricted to supporting a few 4-H oriented events per year outside of our regular club meetings. Hence, club activity was largely social with an attitude that if you wanted to add another activity to the schedule, you can take the lead, get everyone else on board, and we'd do it. Subsequently, new recruits had to stick around for a bit to get to "the really good stuff" our club was doing and that can be difficult with an established tightly-knit group.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, we were able to accomplish some pretty incredible feats. Every year we assisted with the California 4-H State Field Day (formerly State Presentation Day) by providing presentation judges, a sports equipment check-out station for the presenters' bored siblings, and the occasional snack bar. We were also able to give a campus tour whenever the <a href="http://www.ca4h.org/conference/slc/">California 4-H State Leadership Conference</a> was held at UC Davis.</p>

You See Davis Days is a three-day event where we host high school-aged 4-Hers from the Thursday before to the morning of UC Davis's annual open house, Picnic Day. Every year we hosted one or two dozen 4-Hers, taking them to class with us, leading workshops on college preparation, taking them on tours of notable campus locations, and generally showing them what it is really like to be a college student at UC Davis. If we were not blessed with the amazing coordination skills of the club members who stepped up to chair the event, it would have been a logistical nightmare. We had one member available at almost all times - quite the feat when we only had 4 members during my junior year - but aside from occasionally arriving late to a tour, we never had any serious injuries, run ins with the cops, or even real complaints. The delegates always gave positive reviews of the event, the college, and the club by the time their parents came to pick them up on Saturday and many said the event actually convinced them that college was worthwhile. Beyond the positive reviews, some of the delegates actually ended up coming to UCD (it isn't unusual to get a Facebook friend request from a past delegate) and some even joined the club during my senior year.</p>
<p>My time with Collegiate 4-H at UC Davis helped me continue working with the 4-H program while challenging me to develop new leadership skills to deal with such a small group. Despite all the work it entailed, I am glad I stuck with it and hope that the club will continue its excellent work for another 76 years.</p>
