				<h3>Hi!</h3>
				<h3>My name is <strong>Kyle Oliveira</strong>. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UC Davis with a minor in
					Contemporary Leadership and a Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering from Cornell University.</h3>
				<h3>After graduating undergrad in June of 2009, I did some assistant work for a <a href="http://jeneration.com">Drupal developer</a>
					for a bit, programmed some neat stuff for the <a href="http://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/index.html">Department of the Navy</a>
					after that, worked in a <a href="http://k9dna.org">laboratory that researches canine genomics</a> at Cornell University,
					and eventually joined  Cornell's central information technology	unit supporting <a href="http://www.dfa.cornell.edu/kfs/" target="_blank">Cornell's implementation of the Kuali Financial System</a>.</h3>
				<h3>Now, I work for <a href="http://www.oportun.com">Oportun</a>!</h3>
				<h3>Please take a look around my site to get to know me, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests.</h3>
				<h3>Thanks!</h3>
