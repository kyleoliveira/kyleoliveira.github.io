<h1>Secure Programming Clinic for Beginning Programmers</h1>
<h2><em>Spring 2009</em></h2>
<p><img src="http://www.kyleoliveira.net/sites/default/files/images/SPC04-small.JPG" alt="Me, presenting to the ECS 40 class for the Secure Programming Clinic, 5/13/09" class="push-right" height="287" width="250">For the internship component of my Contemporary Leadership minor, I teamed with <a href="http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/bishop/index.html">Professor Matt Bishop</a> from the UC Davis Department of Computer Science to present a clinic on secure programming for beginners. The clinic, prepared over the course of my senior year and finally presented during Spring Quarter 2009, was conceived due to the observation that most literature on computer security is written for programmers who have been coding for quite sometime and understand the jargon. With this in mind, our intention was to provide a way of introducing beginners (i.e. freshmen) to secure programming practices <em>early</em> so as to prevent the most common bad habits from developing in the first place.</p>
<p>Phase one was producing a website listing potential security issues and the steps to resolve them. Each issue had its own page, usually with an example of a bad practice followed by an explanation and an example of the associated good practice. This phase had already begun when I entered the project (the clinic had been presented in 2006 in a slightly different form) and I continued it by adding more issue pages, updating content and cleaning up poorly written pages from the previous clinic incarnation. This process ran from around December 2008 to the night before the clinic presentation.</p>

We chose the ECS 40 class because it is largely freshmen (usually the second programming class taken at UCD) so the programmers in question are still relatively new to the field, but their understanding is sophisticated enough to get the gist of the issues presented. During the 20 minute presentation I covered checking inputs to prevent buffer overflow (and what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buffer_overflow">buffer overflow</a> is); writing modular, highly reuseable code; and properly documenting code (in the form of in-line comments and more sophisticated documentation programs like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doxygen">doxygen</a>). I then introduced the next phase of the project and answered questions from the class. At the end of the presentation, I passed out handouts with more information on the topics I covered, the URL for the website, and further instructions for the next phase.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kyleoliveira.net/sites/default/files/images/SPC03-small.JPG" alt="Me, reviewing code with a student for the Secure Programming Clinic, 5/22/09" class="push-right" height="189" width="250"> For phase three I reviewed the students' code for their next assignment before they turned it in to the professor. I discussed what sort of issues I intended to go over in my presentation and the professor (<a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/lecturers/index.html#Davis">Sean Davis</a>) adjusted the assignment to fit my specifications while still covering the topics required for the class. The resulting program required the students to perform various forms of bounds checking using asserts and the maximum value macros in the climits library.</p>
<p>At my presentation to the class, I had the students sign up for appointment times and instructed the to go over the handout, check out the website, and get their code to me a day before their appointment times. The appointments started a week after my presentation and seemed to have mixed results. On the one hand, most students <em>did not</em> get their work to me on time, so rather than reviewing their code beforehand and going over selected sections during the appointment I switched to covering particular issues for the program in general ("Do you understand what INT_MAX is used for and why we're using it?")<img src="http://www.kyleoliveira.net/sites/default/files/images/SPC01-small.JPG" alt="Me, reviewing code with a student for the Secure Programming Clinic, 5/22/09" class="push-left" height="189" width="250"> and asking questions to get the students to start thinking about where in the program they should be applying what I was teaching them ("Which variables should you be checking for number overflow and what will the assert look like?"). Further, many of the students did not even get their code to me <em>at all</em> beforehand and stated that they were not aware they were supposed to when I met with them (despite my having stating these directions during the presentation, on the website, and to some extent on the class newsgroup) or they were not ready to turn in the assignment. The latter could have been an error on my part (I may not have been clear that the code need not be ready for final submission or, even, compilation), but the former was probably due to the students just not being on top of their course work, or poor class attendence (the day I was to present was listed on the syllabus as a review day for the midterm scheduled for the class period immediately following my presentation). On the other hand, though, most of the students seemed to understand the concepts I was teaching and, if they didn't at first, were able to grasp them after a little more explanation. Some even had secure programming questions of their own or expressed interest in taking the computer security course (ECS 153) in the future.</p>
<p>As proposed, phase four will be to set aside time for a regular (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.) clinic with a designated "clinician" for freshman programmers to go to all quarter-long. Barring that though, I have been told that the clinic may be held in the future pending review of its results. I collected samples of each group's code (immediately after the appointment time if they did not turn it in beforehand) which will be compared to the final code submitted for the assignment. If the results are good, then we may see this clinic continue into the near future. Unfortunately, since I am graduating, I will not be the one to carry it on. Regardless, it was an excellent learning experience for me and I wish Professors Bishop and Davis the best of luck in the future.</p>
