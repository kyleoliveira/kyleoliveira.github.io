|       Dark Chocolate Lava Cookies       |
+-----------------------------------------+

2 1/2 Sticks Unsalted Butter   \ 1. Cream these, then add...
2     Cups   Sugar             /

2     Eggs                   \ 2. Add to the creamed mix, and combine...
1     Tbsp Vanilla           /

3/4   Cups Dark Cocoa Powder \
2     Cups Flour              \ 3. In a separate bowl, sift together...
1/2   Tsp Salt                /
1     Tsp Baking Soda        /


4. Slowly add dry mix into wet mix, and stir until combined.

5. USE YOUR COOKIE (ICE CREAM) SCOOP! Roll each scoop of dough into 
   a ball and roll it around in a bowl of sugar until coated evenly.

6. Place each ball on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.

7. Bake at 350 F for ~10 minutes

Notes:

* The butter needs to be at least room temperature to cream it. 
  It still works fine if you take it out of the fridge and 
  over-microwave it a little bit, though.

* If you don't have a sifter, a whisk works well to get the dry mix 
  to a uniform consistency.

* I use an electric mixer to do the creaming, etc. but a spatula 
  and a whisk could do in a pinch.
