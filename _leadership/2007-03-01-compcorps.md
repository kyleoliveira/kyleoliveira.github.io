As a "Comp Corps" member I presented workshops and trainings at 4-H conferences on subjects ranging from Photoshopping to Website Construction to Taking Advantage of Online Resources (Google, YouTube, etc.). I helped maintain the Shooting Sports portion of the state 4-H website (which is run by the Computer Corps as a group project) and facilitated both face-to-face and instant messenger meetings. I prepared media for a number of Comp Corps projects as well: besides the regular workshop materials we made, I finished off the Simulations and Presentations kits for our Workshop-in-a-Box series of technology presentation material as well as an <a href="http://www.ca4h.org/compcorps/CountyTechTeamBook.pdf">introductory pamplet</a> for starting up a 4-H technology team similar to the Computer Corps on the county level</p>

What kept me coming back to the team year after year, however, were the excellent team dynamics. Youth and adult members took equal roles in all aspects of the group: running projects, planning and presenting workshops, leading meetings and internal trainings, etc. It was challenging to catch up to the level of some of the older team members, but it was <em>incredibly</em> empowering to gain those skills and be able to, for example, teach an hour-long class of 9 to 69 year-old 4-H members and leaders how to build PowerPoint slides into a lovely presentation. I gained an incalculable amount of experience working with diverse groups of people - from the aforementioned workshop participants, to State Ambassador teams seeking tech support, to University of California representatives defining specifications for our state website and photo album, to high school-aged conference delegates in need of something to do in their downtime between sessions. Between those interpersonal skills and the general computer knowledge I gained from researching and presenting to 4-Hers (which I still attribute to getting me my current tech support job in the <a href="http://caes.ucdavis.edu/">College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences Deans Office</a>), my time with the California 4-H Computer Corps is surely one of the defining moments in my leadership career.</p>
