		<h3>Hi!</h3>
		<h3>My name is Kyle Oliveira. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UC Davis with a minor in
			Contemporary Leadership. After graduating in June of 2009, I did some assistant work for a Drupal developer
			for a bit, programmed some neat stuff for the Department of the Navy after that, worked in a laboratory that
			researches canine genomics at Cornell University, and now I work for Cornell's central information technology
			unit supporting Cornell's implementation of the Kuali Financial System.</h3>
		<h3>Please take a look around my site to get to know me, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests.</h3>
		<h3>Thanks!</h3>
		<h3>- Kyle Oliveira</h3>
