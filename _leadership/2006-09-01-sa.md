<h1>California 4-H State Ambassador</h1>
<h2><em>June 2005 - September 2006</em></h2>

It is an opportunity for older 4-H members (typically 16-18 year-olds) to represent the University of California 4-H Youth Development Program and their 4-H peers as a whole on the state, national, and international level in roles that "promote leadership through education and service." Each team is required, in addition to being the face of state 4-H events, to organize a service project and organize the annual <a href="http://www.ca4h.org/conference/slc/">California 4-H State Leadership Conference</a>. My team was myself and seven others (one other guy and six gals) with four adult advisors.</p>

<p>As a State Ambassador I traveled the state representing the state program. I helped present awards to competitors and judge exhibitors at the State Fair and staffed a booth at the Ag Day at the State Capitol (the Governator is a lot shorter than he looks). I also attended sectional 4-H conferences, presenting workshops on older 4-H member opportunities and MC'ing during the conferences' general assemblies. My team and I were the face of 4-H for fundraisers and I worked with the State 4-H Foundation in securing a scholarship sponsorship from American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers (ASFMRA).</p>

<p>Our service project attempted to find ways to assist county level older member leaders (county All-stars/Ambassadors) in networking and sharing leadership skills. To this end, we developed a handbook for these 4-Hers that covered useful topics ranging from Parliamentary Procedure to Icebreakers. I personally put together the Icebreakers section and helped compile each team member's parts into the rough draft. The second part of our service project involved adding a new session to the State Leadership Conference, All-star Afterhours, that gathered all of the All-stars in attendance and engaged them in networking and teambuilding activities. The original idea was to recognize these special leadership teams by gathering them together after the regular sessions of the conference (hence, afterhours) and just get them really excited about meeting each other, finding ways to work with their own team, and, subsequently working with other counties. This worked fairly well - the response was so good that All-star Afterhours has been included in the program of every State Leadership Conference since our year. The only hitches we found were that: (1) we relied heavily on volunteers to run the event and (2) the event was scheduled to run after 9PM on every night of the conference. The first issue was not much of a deal; we had excellent volunteers who did a wonderful job with the delegates. After the fact, our team just wished we had taken a more hands-on role in the event, that's all. The second issue was more important. The State Leadership Conference is four days (three nights) long with activities running all day on each day. Since the event was scheduled so late and tended to run a little long, the delegates were extremely worn out as the conference progressed and we actually got a few complaints that delegates were not getting enough sleep. Future teams solved this by changing the event to a one-night affair, typically on the first night of the conference so delegates can continue to network on their own time in the next few days.</p>

<p>I have touched on the State Leadership Conference (SLC) a little bit already, but it really deserves its own section. We began our planning for SLC during our team orientation - 14 months before it was to be held. We gathered a team of trusted volunteers and broke into committees to handle preparations for different parts of the conference: Assemblies, Education, Logistics, Deans (for code of conduct issues during the conference), and Recreation. I was part of the Assemblies and Deans committees, so leading up to the conference I helped lay the schedule for assemblies, find inspirational speakers, select the MC's for each assembly, work with Comp Corps to ensure there would be technical support for any presentations during the assembly, and finally set up the stage and assembly hall between assemblies.</p>

<p>Our SLC was held at UC San Diego. Since the conference had never been held at this location before, we had to do some considerable logistical planning. We visited the campus twice before the conference and worked with campus officials to decide where the delegates would stay, where conference events would be held, and, generally, what we could do with campus facilities. Besides the new location, we also added a few changes to the conference itself. First, we implemented the aforementioned All-star Afterhours which proved to be an excellent way to engage the youth leaders in the delegation.</p>

<p>Second, we made the conference dance that is traditionally held on the last day of the conference a formal dance. We requested that all delegates dress nicely and provided a dress borrowing station for the girls in case anyone had a spare dress or forgot to bring one. We held the dance outside under the moonlight as well, and decorated the plaza tastefully. These changes kept the dance classy while still being fun, which can be difficult when dealing with a high school-aged crowd.</p>

<p>Finally, rather than using a paid inspirational speaker for the opening assembly speech, we chose our ambassador team. All eight of us gave a speech about what we had learned through 4-H. Mine related my shooting sports project to the important life skills (organization, punctuality, self-control, patience, etc.) I have gained. I used my shooting sports equipment (including my rifle - unloaded, of course) as props and spoke for about 20 minutes in front of the whole assembly. There were about 500 delegates. It was nerve-racking, but apparently I did well: it felt like all 500 delegates personally complimented me on my speech over the next four days.</p>

<p>All in all, my 14 months as a California 4-H State Ambassador comprise one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. It was challenging, engaging, exhausting, fun, fulfilling, and envigorating all at the same time. I can barely put describe it in so many words, but what I can say that if I had to do it again I would. I learned so many things - about myself, about working with others, about planning and presenting - that I can say that I would not be where I am now without having been a California 4-H State Ambassador.</p>
